# Outliers Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for detecting outliers in a dataset using various statistical methods and visualization techniques.

## Overview

Outliers detection is a crucial step in data preprocessing. Outliers can significantly impact the results of your analysis and machine learning models. This notebook demonstrates methods to identify and visualize outliers in a dataset.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load datasets using popular libraries like Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data distribution and identify potential outliers using statistical summaries.
- **Visualization**: Use plots like box plots, scatter plots, and histograms to visualize data and detect outliers.
- **Outliers Detection Methods**: Implement and compare various outlier detection techniques such as:
  - Z-score method
  - Interquartile Range (IQR) method
  - Scatter plot method

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sohaum/Outliers-Detection.git
